Welcome to goodreads' documentation!
=====================================
This package provides a Python interface for the `Goodreads
API <http://goodreads.com/api>`__. Using it, you can do pretty much
anything that Goodreads allows to do with their own data.

Dependencies
------------

This package depends on the following packages:

-  xmltodict
-  requests
-  rauth

They can be installed using ``pip``.

::

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to contribute to this package, you will need the ``nose``
package as well.

Installation
------------

To install, run the following command from the top-level package
directory.

::

    sudo python setup.py install

Getting Started
---------------

The first thing is to request an API key from Goodreads
`here <https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys>`__. Once you have it, you can
create a client instance to query Goodreads.

.. code:: python

    from goodreads import client
    gc = client.GoodreadsClient(<api_key>, <api_secret>)

To access some of the methods, you need `OAuth <http://oauth.net/>`__
for authorization.

.. code:: python

    gc.authenticate(<access_token>, <access_token_secret>)

Note that ``access_token`` and ``access_token_secret`` are different
from developer key and secret. For the development step, you can call
the same function with no parameters to get authorization. It will open
a URL pointing a Goodreads page for OAuth permission. For your
application, you can direct the user to that particular URL, ask him/her
to authorize your app and save the returning ``access_token`` and
``access_token_secret`` in your database.

Examples
--------

This package provides a Python interface for most Goodreads API methods.
Here are a few examples demonstrating how to access data on Goodreads.

Books
~~~~~

Let's access the first book added to Goodreads! It is the book with id
1.

.. code:: python

    book = gc.book(1)

Once you have the ``GoodreadsBook`` instance for the book, you can
access data for the queried book.

.. code:: python

    >>> book.title
    u'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)'
    >>> authors = book.authors
    >>> authors[0].name
    u'J.K. Rowling'
    >>> book.average_rating
    u'4.49'

Authors
~~~~~~~

You can get information about an author as well.

.. code:: python

    >>> author = gc.author(2617)
    >>> author.name
    u'Jonathan Safran Foer'
    >>> author.works_count
    u'13'
    >>> author.books
    [Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Everything Is Illuminated, Eating Animals, Tree of Codes, Everything is Illuminated & Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The unabridged pocketbook of lightning, The Future Dictionary of America, A Convergence of Birds: Original Fiction and Poetry Inspired by Joseph Cornell, New American Haggadah, The Sixth Borough]

Users
~~~~~

User data can be retrieved by user id or username.

.. code:: python

    >>> user = gc.user(1)
    >>> user.name
    u'Otis Chandler'
    >>> user.user_name
    u'otis'
    >>> user.small_image_url
    u'http://d.gr-assets.com/users/1189644957p2/1.jpg'

Groups
~~~~~~

Let's find a group discussing Python and get more information about it.

.. code:: python

    >>> g = gc.find_groups("Python")
    >>> g = groups[0]
    >>> g['title']
    u'The Computer Scientists'
    >>> group = gc.group(g['id'])
    >>> group.description
    u'Only for Committed Self Learners and Computer Scientists Who are Starving for
    Information, and Want to Advance their Skills Through: Reading, Practicing and
    Discussion Computer Science and Programming Books.'

Events
~~~~~~

Goodreads API also allows to list events happening in an area.

.. code:: python

    >>> events = gc.list_events(21229)
    >>> event = events[0]
    >>> event.title
    u'Books and Cocktails'
    >>> event.address
    u'120 N. Front St.'
    >>> event.city
    u'Wrightsville'

Contribution
------------

If you find an API method that is not supported by this package, feel
free to create a Github issue. Also, you are more than welcome to submit
a pull request for a bug fix or additional feature.
